# bazu
This repository is an addition that was made to the bazu project.

It consists of a robotic arm visualized in rviz and simulated in a gazebo.
Contains 2 plugins:

1. to bring the manipulator to a desired position configured within the script


3. To teleoperate the robot manipulator using the keyboard keys.


      'a' and 's' control the movement of joint_1
      
      
      'd' and 'f' control the movement of joint_2
      
      
      'g' and 'h' control the movement of the joint_3
      
      
      'z' and 'x' control the movement of the joint_4
      
      
      'c' and 'v' control the movement of the joint_5
      
      


Note: For the gazebo simulation you have to change the location address of the meshes in the urdf.
